## What are reflections?

Reflection enables you to obtain information about assemblies, modules, and types dynamically. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to work with types that are not known at compile time or when you want to perform tasks like dynamically loading assemblies, creating instances of types, invoking methods, and accessing or modifying properties.
